# Markdown Previewer

In this project I created a simple markdown previewer.
This project is from freeCodeCamp course and it's based on the React library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/md-previewer.git
```

Install the packages:
```
cd md-previewer
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
npm start
```

In your browser, go to http://localhost:3000/, and play the game.


## ...or watch it live!

You can play the game [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/md-previewer/).


## Main features

* The project is based basically on two different text areas.
* The one on the left should receive your markdown text, and in real-time you should see the HTML version of your text in the textarea on the right.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
